At the beginning of April, our ever growing club met to learn about and discuss the idea of transhumanism.

Our own member and newly-elected Club Fixer, Michaelann, has been involved in the transhumanist community for several years–a community that considers the undeniable impact of technology on the human experience.

Transhumanism exists at the intersection of many important social concerns, including politics, law, individual and public health, education, and art. Each topic is heavily impacted by ethical considerations around emerging and future technologies.

At the heart of transhumanism lies a profound question: How do we navigate the tumultuous waters of technological advancement while remaining true to our humanity? It is a question that has plagued philosophers, visionaries, and poets alike, beckoning us to contemplate our place in a world where the boundaries between man and machine blur with each passing day.

For Michaelann, who prefers to be considered a poet instead of an expert, transhumanism is not merely a philosophical concept, but a fairytale of technology—a story in progress, with humanity as its main character. As we develop new forms of technology, we also develop new forms of bodies, adapting and evolving in response to the ever-changing landscape of innovation.

But with change comes challenges, and as technology permeates every aspect of our lives, we are faced with a stark reality: we are on the brink of a future where the very essence of what it means to be human is called into question. Homo Deus, the next stage of human evolution, looms on the horizon, casting a shadow over our current understanding of existence.

Yet, amidst this uncertainty, there is hope. Humanity, we are reminded, is resilient, capable of rising to meet the challenges of tomorrow with compassion and grace. As we stand at the crossroads of our own evolution, Michaelann presented two stark choices: to succumb to the destructive forces of division and conflict, or to embrace a future where empathy and understanding reign supreme.

But as we ponder the future, we must also reckon with the past. It was asked what is the first transhumanist event? fire? spear? simple tools or complex tools? Our journey towards transhumanism is not a linear progression, but a fluid process, shaped by the ebb and flow of history. From the dawn of humanity's earliest days to the present moment, we have always sought to transcend our limitations, to push the boundaries of what is possible.

We also talked at length about how sometimes our brains are stuck in the past. When you admit your animal humanity, you can forgive yourself for the ways in which technology has made you what you don't want to be. A term that was shared for this is future shock - technology affects us at a faster rate than we and our bodies ability to adapt can keep up.

As we venture into uncharted territory, we are confronted with a host of ethical questions and moral dilemmas. Who defines what it means to be human? What rights and responsibilities accompany the dawn of a new era of existence? And how do we navigate the treacherous waters of technological advancement without losing sight of our shared humanity? It was pointed out that a lot of the concerns around transgenderism is a harbinger (precursor) for how people react to body modifications and prompts the question of who has permission to change themselves.

In the face of these challenges, it is easy to feel overwhelmed, to lose sight of the path forward. But amidst the chaos, there is solace to be found in the power of storytelling. Fairy Tales, we are reminded, are not merely flights of fancy, but powerful tools for shaping society and guiding our collective destiny. 

As we chart our course into the unknown realms of transhumanism, let us remember that we are the authors of our own story, the architects of our own destiny. And though the road ahead may be fraught with peril, it is also brimming with possibility—a testament to the boundless potential of the human spirit.

So let us embrace the future with open hearts and open minds, knowing that with each step forward, we are writing a new chapter in the grand saga of human existence. For in the end, it is not resistance that defines us, but our capacity for growth, adaptation, and transformation.

## Reflection

I enjoyed this activity immensely, the basic setup of having an expert run a roundtable discussion on their chosen topics just seems to work so well. People come ready to question and discuss. 

Michaelann set us up for success by establishing herself not as an expert but more of a poet or storyteller. She was quick to let us know she doesn't have all the answers and pointed more to the importance of thinking actively about our future evolution, always wanting to engage and see where the conversations lead. 

The group actively engaged in the discussion and posed many insightful questions, leading to various interesting tangents without straying too far from the main topic. 

Following this activity, I've slowly begun to examine my relationship with technology more deeply. I've also started to show myself a bit more compassion when I feel overwhelmed or overly influenced by the prevailing trends in technology. Instead of blaming myself for not being more knowledgeable or adept, I acknowledge that these challenges are inherent in our basic evolution. Accepting this reality allows me to approach situations with greater understanding and move forward with mindfulness in navigating the constantly shifting technological landscape we inhabit today. Wherever that ever changing future takes us and the Sleepy Bois I definitely look forward to hosting more round table discussions like this in the future.
