While driving out for a snowy Sunday afternoon for a hike, I wondered what might be the limits of what I would do for the Sleepy Bois Club. The weather was not suited for a picturesque hike, and though we knew the risks of a Springtime hike in Utah, we had hoped for at worst a cool hike, not a snow storm warning… But I was still excited to croak with the bois!

Our small group of extreme (“beginner-friendly”) hike enthusiasts gathered at the snow-covered trailhead, where some of us questioned if the hike would still be on. It was, indeed, on. We dawned ourselves with our finest snow-appropriate hiking jackets (though most of us apparently packed tropical) and started our way on the trail towards Rocky Mouth Falls.

The beginning of the hike was the most challenging part. Aadesh had selected a connecting trail to the short Rocky Mouth Falls trail to design the perfect hike for a group of beginners. The trail was simple enough, but the unexpected cold weather combined with slippery mud and snow made the initial ascent a little too challenging for a few who had to turn back to warm up sandal-shod toes.

Though a perfectly scenic warm-weather walk would have been ideal, the circumstances of our hike complimented the overall theme of our study guide post for the hike. Hiking can be fairly straightforward and simple, especially during the hiking high season. But, the outdoors can ramp up in difficulty quickly and, if you’re not prepared, you might find that your “beginner” hike has turned into a little more than you bargained for. Thankfully we had planned a hike well within our means, so adjusting to the circumstances to stay safe was easy.

When our small group summited the small hill that commenced our hike, we turned around to view the valley off the Wasatch front. With the falling snow, there was nothing to see at all. Frankly, it was one of the prettiest sights I’ve seen. At that moment, I felt a wave of appreciation for what we were doing. If not for the Club having planned this activity for this day and my commitment to the group, I definitely wouldn’t have been out on that hike. But because I felt that others were depending on me and because of the safety I felt while hiking in a group, I saw a view of Utah that I hadn’t seen before and one that I genuinely hope to see again. 

It may not have been the best day for a hike, but it was certainly a special day for a hike. 

As we hiked closer to the falls, the scene was prettier and prettier. The fallen snow on Utah foliage and an un-hiked snow-covered trail was a sight to see. It was only surpassed by the view of the falls. The view of the glacial cascade in the snow was beautiful, and we passed several minutes there in the falling snow before turning back down the trail.

When the group of hikers returned to the trailhead, we were happy to see our friends waiting for us, warm in their cars. We capped off the day with some Cinco de Mayo tacos so that those who couldn’t make it up to the falls to hang with the group a little bit before calling it a day.

I love living in a place where the outdoors are immediately and easily accessible at any time. And it just so happens to be home to some cool people who make living here enjoyable no matter the activity, place, or weather.
