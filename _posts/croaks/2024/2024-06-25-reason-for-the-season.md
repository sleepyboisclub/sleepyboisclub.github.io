On June 6, at 6pm the Sleepy Bois Club hosted their first annual summer BBQ with a playful, lightly satanic theme, "Reason for the Season." Despite the unique twist and the busy summer season, the event turned out to be a delightful gathering for those who attended.
 
The BBQ featured the enticing aroma of grilled burgers, and hot dogs which drew everyone together. Summer is the perfect time to embrace the joys of recreation and recharge from our busy lives. The warm weather and longer days provide endless opportunities for outdoor activities, whether it's a refreshing swim, a scenic hike, or a spontaneous Satan themed bbq. Taking time to enjoy these simple pleasures not only enhances our physical health but also boosts our mood and strengthens our connections with family and friends. So, let's make the most of the season, step outside, and savor the happiness and relaxation that summer recreation brings.

To beat the heat, some members ran around the yard, engaging in games, while others relaxed in the shade with cold drinks.In the end, the Sleepy Bois enjoyed a memorable evening filled with laughter, great food, and the joy of summer, making this quirky-themed BBQ a highlight of the season.
