On September 4, we will participate in a seminar on the fundamentals of daily movemenet. 

One of our members will lead the seminar, sharing with us the basics of movemement, what you should keep in mind,and how to incorporate movement into your daily life. Then we will have an open discussion on the topic in general and the principles we learn in the seminar.

If we're lucky we may even participate in some short group exercises ðŸ‘€
