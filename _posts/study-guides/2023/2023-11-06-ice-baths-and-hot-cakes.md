On December 3rd, the Sleepy Bois Club will meet in the morning to do an ice bath in the Provo River. Upon completion of the ice bath, we will head directly to a local restaurant for a hot breakfast, hot coffee, and warm company. The following day, we will meet in the evening to share our experiences with December’s ice bath activity and our past experiences with ice baths, cold showers, or any cold water therapy activities.

Given that some may be averse to doing a winter ice bath in a mountain stream, we encourage all to participate in this month’s activity to their comfort level. If you are not sure about committing to a bone-chilling ice bath, doing your own cold showers or cold water activities to discuss at the Monday night meetup is enthusiastically encouraged!
