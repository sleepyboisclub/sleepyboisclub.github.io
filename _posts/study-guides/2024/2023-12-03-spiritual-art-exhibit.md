The first Sleepy Bois Croak of 2024 will be on Wednesday, January 3rd.

We will attend the [Springville Museum of Artâ€™s Annual Spiritual and Religious Art of Utah exhibit](https://www.smofa.org/37th-annual-spiritual-religious-art-of-utah). 

From the Springville Museum of Art website:

> The Springville Museum of Art invites all Utah artists to enter this exhibition which celebrates the diversity of religious experience and belief in our community. Using different media to express these ideas, artists create works which will engage and inspire viewers to contemplate and reflect on the vibrant spiritual traditions we share.

As the museum is only open for evenings on Wednesdays, we will visit the museum as a group on the 3rd. We will tour the exhibit from 6-7 PM and from 7-8 PM we will gather to share our experience of the exhibit as well as any thoughts around the subject matter of the exhibit: the Utah religious experience.

If you are unable to attend on the 3rd, we highly recommend attending sometime during the month of December and sharing your thoughts in the Discord.

Look for updates regarding this croak in the Sleepy Bois Club Discord server or via the club mailing list (contact Dustin or Kekoa to be added to the email list).
