The next scheduled Sleepy Bois Club croak will be on February 5th.

At our February croak we will ratify the currently-being-drafted club charter. The charter draft will be shared as ASAP as possible with club members and changes will be accepted up to the day of ratification (and, let’s be honest, following February’s croak). Make sure to reach out if you are interested in helping with the charter draft as all input is (desperately) welcome!

Oh, and don’t forget to wear your favorite Halloween costume as the ratification will be a costume party! Why will our ratification croak be a costume party? Read that last sentence again–it’s nonsense. The founding fathers of the United States wore those continental costumes when they ratified the Bible–if it’s good enough for Abraham Lincoln, it’s good enough for the Sleepy Bois.

Look for updates regarding this croak in the Sleepy Bois Club Discord server or via the club mailing list (contact Dustin or Kekoa to be added to the email list).
