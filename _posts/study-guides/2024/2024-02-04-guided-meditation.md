The SBC will croak in March with a guided meditation activity and discussion.

The club has a high level of interest in practicing meditation, the benefits of meditation, and even learning to guide group meditation. At this activity, one of our members will guide their first group meditation, some will meditate for the first time, and all of us are looking forward to the experience.

After the guided meditation, we will discuss our experience as a group, our personal or previous experiences with meditation, and other resources and expert opinions.
