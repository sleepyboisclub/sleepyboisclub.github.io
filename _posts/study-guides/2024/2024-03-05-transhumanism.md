Our newly-elected Club Fixer, Michaelann, has been involved in the transhumanist community for several years–a community that considers the undeniable impact of technology on the human experience. 

At this SBC Croak, Michaelann will share her unique perspectives on Transhumanism, informed by her religious experience–spanning the time before, during, and after her tenure leading the Mormon Transhumanist Association–and her life-long dedication to non-profit causes and community building.

Transhumanism exists at the intersection of many important social concerns, including politics, law, individual and public health, education, and art. Each is heavily impacted by ethical considerations around emerging and future technologies.

Come with an open mind, an attitude of curiosity, and appreciation for new ideas and the people who are willing to share them with our little club.
