The SBC will croak in May will be a short hike.

The SBC resides in Utah, a state with incredible access to and a vast diversity of nature. Many of our members are avid outdoor enthusiasts, others would like to spend more time in nature.

Our official club mountain goat, Aadesh, will be selecting a hike along the Wasatch Front that should take us about two hours to complete (not including travel to the trailhead).

Come enjoy a lovely beginner-friendly hike with friends ðŸ˜Š
