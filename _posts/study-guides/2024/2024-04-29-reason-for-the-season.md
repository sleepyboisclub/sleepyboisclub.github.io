As we bring to a close some of the more festive seasons of the year, we have a chance to start anew with the next reason to celebrate: grilling season. 

The Sleepy Bois Club will be kicking off the summer with a celebration of the warmer weather. Itâ€™s going to be a hot one, as the BBQ flames will burn our flesh (and vegetarian options too) and there will certainly be a gnashing of teeth at this summertime feast! Make sure to BYOB to cool off from the heat!

Join us 6/6 at 6 (pm) for a lightly themed BBQ and fun times with friends!
