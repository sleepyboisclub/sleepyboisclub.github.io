For the month of July, the Sleepy Bois Club will be volunteering with the Urban Arts Gallery during the annual Urban Arts Festival ([https://utaharts.org/en/urban-arts-festival/](https://utaharts.org/en/urban-arts-festival/)). ‚ÄúThe Urban Arts Festival is a FREE community event organized by Utah Arts Alliance. Started in 2011, the Urban Arts Festival is one of the most unique and exciting events in SLC.‚Äù ([www.urbanartsgallery.org](http://www.urbanartsgallery.org))

We endearingly call our club a ‚Äúphilosophy and kindness club‚Äù because we firmly believe in the value of philosophy for a thoughtful and compassionate life. However, if philosophy is not kind or practical in the real world, its value is lost on those who practice it (excepting intellectual masturbation‚Äìwhich can be fun, of course üòú).

For the purpose of practicing kind philosophy, we will be helping out at this free community art festival, hosted by the Urban Arts Gallery. We hope that volunteering our time and efforts encourages us to remember that the topics we consider in the Sleepy Bois Club have real implications on the world we live in. If we wish to see a world that better reflects the values we hold individually or collectively, we can start most effectively with our own time and efforts.
