In the month of September, our little club will attend a [Two Arrows Zen Dharma lecture](https://twoarrowszen.org/upcoming/daily-meditation/) in Salt Lake City. 

Some of our club members have attended Zen lectures and meditations before or have studied other branches of Buddhism. As such, attending a local Buddhist lecture or meditation was one of the activities that most interested our members in our activity survey last year.

Though many of us are familiar with the concepts of Buddhism through our own studies, we are excited and grateful for the opportunity to enter a sacred space and learn the practices and philosophies of Buddhism from a local institution. We are lucky to have several local churches and religious institutions that host open door lectures and activities to our community.
