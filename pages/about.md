The Sleepy Bois Club was established as a digital third space to fight lonliness and meaningless through the exploration and practice of philosophy and kindness.

As the club experiments in finding fulfillment through connecting with self and others, we share our experiences online for all to see, read, and practice in their own lives. We encourage all to engage in seeking meaning and connection, whether in our community or elsewhere!
